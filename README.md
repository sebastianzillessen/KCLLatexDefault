# KCLLatexDefault
Small default layout for articles to hand them in at King's College London (including nice title page)

The official King's Logo has been taken from http://www.kcl.ac.uk.

The front page has been adapted from the official front page of KCL's MSc Project styleguide which was ported to LaTex by Andre MÃ¼ller (https://github.com/mueller-andre) and was further adapted by Sebastian Zillessen (https://github.com/sebastianzillessen).

Feel free to modify it or adapt it to your requirements, just make sure that you share your wisdom with everyone else by submitting a merge request.
